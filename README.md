## swordfighting

A WebGL project using HTML and JS. Made for my Computer Graphics final project at Knox College. Based on figure.html and figure.js from Chapter 9 in the Interactive Computer Graphics, Eighth Edition by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner.

## Overview

It is a rock-paper-scissors-esque demo where two figures with swords decide if they want to attack or not. Camera controls are using the keyboard.

## Future Plans

If I ever go back to this project, I would give each player more actions to take, making it truly a rock-paper-scissors game. The main restraint was animating the figures, so with more time, I could make it happen. I would also add more of a background and better camera controls so it feels like the player is watching a full simulation.
